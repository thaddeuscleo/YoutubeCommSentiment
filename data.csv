UgyLtxQ7EePFv-lbLwB4AaABAg,"I bought the M1 Mac mini before this iMac came out. It‚Äôs a nice machine, and silent. I use it every day, and I love it. Apple‚Äôs stance is that the Mac mini is a Mac for savvier users. I understand why Linus came to the conclusion that one should buy the Mac mini instead of this machine, but that‚Äôs ignoring a whole bunch of nonsense if you are a less savvy user, and cable clutter even if you are. It‚Äôs not just a display, keyboard, and mouse you‚Äôre giving up to save $800. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ -A small but gorgeous display that gets very bright and looks great in your hone or office, and includes Apple-only features like True Tone which, though Linus hates it, is a real value add for people like me whose eyes just rest a bit easier when the color temperature of our display better matches our environment.s -The webcam and microphone, which you‚Äôll have to hang off your Mac mini and mount to your display, and which will stick out. That‚Äôs hundred dollar USB mic and hundred dollar webcam quality components built into the iMac if you pay for something just as good. -Touch ID in the (EDIT: included) keyboard. -Ignore the mouse and add $50 to the price of the iMac and get a Magic Trackpad. So that‚Äôs a $80 saving on the trackpad, plus it comes in your choice of color. -The speakers. If you want speakers at least as good, add $50+ and at least four extra wires to your desk, including another to the wall because they have to be plugged in. -Want to move your Mac mini setup from room to room? Forget about it.  Here‚Äôs why the Mac mini works better for my setup: I‚Äôm a PC gamer and I have a monitor which is far bigger than the integrated display of the iMac (great for my visual impairment), $200 speakers, a $100 mic, and a $500 audio interface paired with Picture By Picture on my monitor so my PC and Mac can share the same display and speakers at the same time. I use it for DJ gigs to have my Mac running music and my PC running lights and visuals, or I use my Mac for work or my PC for play and easily switch between them. That‚Äôs something the iMac can‚Äôt do: also be a good PC, but compared to my setup which allows for both, the iMac is quite affordable. My monitor was $1000 and my audio interface was, as mentioned, $500. Plus I spent $100 on a USB microphone, I use a keyboard and mouse for Windows and a separate keyboard and trackpad on Mac, and I use an old iPhone as a worse webcam. All in all, I figure I spent $2000 avoiding the iMac as compared to $800 (over the cost of the Mac mini) for it.  So sure, get the Mac mini if you have a specific use case for its flexibility to use multiple displays, its 10 gig ethernet, or it shares a desk with another computer. But if this is to be your only desktop computer, you will enjoy the lack of hassle of the iMac; it is worth every penny over the Mac mini.",Mark Davenport,UCT9jd81a_QAYJyAjf_8WdHw,0,2021-06-16T00:28:34Z,2021-06-16T00:31:00Z,1,True

Ugxan8-MU8uuLLtY_TZ4AaABAg,"Between the Mac Mini vs iMac, I think Linus is quite unfair here. If you use similar spec monitor, speaker, mouse/keyboard, webcam, the cost will be quite similar.  Monitor: you will have to pay north of $400 for a wide gamut, 4k, 500 nit display, 24-32 inches. The iMac also support Dolby Vision which as far as I know non of the monitor support. Speakers: you probably need about $200 for comparable speakers. The iMac also support Dolby Atmos. Mouse/keyboard/webcam/microphone: iMac mouse is terrible but the keyboard is great and it has a fingerprint reader. There is no comparable keyboard in the market. So I will just put $100 here. Your final system with Mac Mini will have 4 different pieces: Mac Mini, monitor, speaker, webcam and 5-6 different wires compare that to the iMac which have 1 cable and one piece in total. Furthermore if you use webcam you will loose 1 port from the Mac Mini, also you need to take time buying and assembling all these different pieces, take care of the empty boxes. You also need to maintain all these external piece like update software/firmware for them, if something go wrong, you need to find help from that specific brand, it is not a good experience at all.  So in total if you want a comparable system, you will pay at least $1400 and a messy table.  If you just want a shitty system then you only need around $400 then the Mac Mini make sense.  Feel free to correct me. If you do please send link to the setup that you think is comparable.",super hero,UCG8diYChPfN6DJaoWlIKzYw,0,2021-06-15T21:35:44Z,2021-06-15T21:42:43Z,0,True

UgzgpGKoqIUtTjevzid4AaABAg,"Reminds me of the lower-end models of the 13"" MacBook Pro's (2016/2107). Had a cheaper i5 6000u/7000u instead of i7... the expensive models got _two_ fans, and a cooling solution rated at +/- 30 watts. They ran the intel CPU's without TDP restriction, instead monitoring everything in their own firmware.   Then the cheaper model. With one fan, and a CPU meant to have 15watt TDP. So they cheaped out on the cooling solution to have a solution rated at around +/- 15 watts. Sounds OK for a 15watt TDP CPU, right? But they _still_ ran it with no restriction, making that thing fly up to over 28watts. Sure, they win benchmarks. But the single poor fan was going crazy. Everyone at the office was looking why my cheaper 2017-model (but no touch bar, yay) was making so much noise, while their 2016 'high up'-models didn't.  All that was needed was a 3rd party tool to restrict the CPU to 15 watts or a bit more, and you could happily use the machine without making noises like a lawnmower was being used. But you had to use a tool to 'fix' it, just because they cheaped out on a) a 2nd fan or b) configuring a TDP-limit in the firmware.",Joris Mak,UCR6q8KqTvzH7tGpBjOdpy-Q,0,2021-06-15T21:05:16Z,2021-06-15T21:05:16Z,0,True

UgxsZf5LoxBfaxZMEt54AaABAg,"M1 is biggest mistake Apple did in recent years. It's just too good for entry level Macs. They should have made 2-core and 4-core variant for Macbook Air and Mac Mini. Such M1 would still be super fast in lightweight tasks thanks to really good single-core performance, but would be slow in productivity tasks like rendering. However with 8-core M1 powering Macbook Air and Mini they can't turn back now. Much more faster M2 won't make a difference. M1 is so fast, that currently rarely anyone needs a faster CPU and if you need more processing power, there's a big chance that a powerful GPU would be much better choice for calculation.  Intel made same mistake with Core2Duo CPUs, where slowest ones had so much OC potential that there was no reason to get anything better. Next releases of Core2 architecture gradually reduced OC capabilities and Core i had OC locked in less expensive models without ""K"".  Apple just started in computer CPU market which is much different than smartphone market, where CPU is significantly smaller factor than in computers. So putting fastest SoC in iPhone helped with sales, while in computers it will kill future sales. M1 Macs were very successful, but I think that people will use them much longer than x86 Macs that sometimes got old really quick.",Leeki85,UCj3sD7pBH2XqvHB5U1hvdYQ,0,2021-06-15T20:15:55Z,2021-06-15T20:15:55Z,0,True
